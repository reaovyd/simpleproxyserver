\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the object that represents the connection pool. 

This is the object responsible for holding each of the user\textquotesingle{}s connection that can later be passed to an event handler like {\ttfamily select(2)} and, then, further processes the connections that correspond to some socket file descriptor. The structure looks like this in the source file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{struct }connectionPool \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keywordtype}{unsigned} \textcolor{keywordtype}{int} pool\_size; \textcolor{comment}{// capped at FD\_SETSIZE}}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keyword}{struct }\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        fd\_set rd\_set;}
\DoxyCodeLine{        fd\_set wr\_set;}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \} rdwr\_fd\_sets; }
\DoxyCodeLine{    \mbox{\hyperlink{structPrioQueue}{PrioQueue}} *pq;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}

\end{DoxyCode}
 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
