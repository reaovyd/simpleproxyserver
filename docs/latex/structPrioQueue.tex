\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the structure that represents the priority queue. 

The operations below manipulate this object. The priority queue follows the max-\/heap invariant as we can quickly yield the maximum element. The structure is implemented as the following inside the source file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{struct }prio\_queue \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keywordtype}{int} heap[MAX\_PRIO\_CAPACITY];}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keywordtype}{int} len;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}

\end{DoxyCode}
 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
include/\mbox{\hyperlink{prio_8h}{prio.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
